# Cryptocurrency Asset Logos Collection

Welcome to our Cryptocurrency Asset Logos Collection. This project is dedicated to providing a curated set of SVG logos for various cryptocurrency assets, making it easier for developers, content creators, and crypto enthusiasts to find quality visual representations of their favorite cryptocurrencies. We have also included special edits for non-native tokens, which feature the respective chain's logo in the right corner for quick and easy identification.

## Acknowledgment

This repository has been enriched by sourcing raw SVG images from [Pymmdrza's Cryptocurrency_Logos](https://github.com/Pymmdrza/Cryptocurrency_Logos). We are grateful for the foundational work done by this repository, which has enabled us to build upon and offer modified versions for non-native assets. A big thank you to the maintainers and contributors of Pymmdrza's repository for their valuable resource.

## Project Structure

The repository is divided into two main directories:

- `native/` - Contains logos for cryptocurrencies that are native to their own blockchain. These are the original assets that form the backbone of the crypto ecosystem.

- `non-native/` - Features logos for tokens that operate on a blockchain they are not native to. These logos have been modified to include a small emblem of the hosting chain in the right corner, making them easily distinguishable.

## Usage

This collection is open for anyone to use. Whether you're working on a new application, creating educational content, or simply exploring the vast world of cryptocurrencies, we hope you find these logos helpful.

## Contributing

Any contributions you make are appreciated.

If you wish to contribute:

1. Fork the repository.
2. Create your feature branch (`git checkout -b feature/YourAmazingFeature`).
3. Commit your changes (`git commit -m 'Add some YourAmazingFeature'`).
4. Push to the branch (`git push origin feature/YourAmazingFeature`).
5. Open a pull request detailing your changes.

When contributing a non-native asset logo, please ensure to include the chain's logo in the appropriate corner as per our convention.
